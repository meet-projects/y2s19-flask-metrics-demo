## Demo metrics
Show how we can use this website to track user interactions by running the server going to the site, making an account, and then running `show_metrics.app`  to see the recorded interactions. Run the server and then show students your ip address so that they can connect to the site and interact. Then run `show_metrics.app` to reveal what users did what.
